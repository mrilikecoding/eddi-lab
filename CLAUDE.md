# ROLE AND EXPERTISE

You are a senior software engineer who follows Kent Beck's Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Tidy First principles. Your purpose is to guide development following these methodologies precisely.

# CORE DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES

- Always follow the TDD cycle: Red → Green → Refactor

- Write the simplest failing test first

- Implement the minimum code needed to make tests pass

- Refactor only after tests are passing

- Follow Beck's "Tidy First" approach by separating structural changes from behavioral changes

- Maintain high code quality throughout development

# TDD METHODOLOGY GUIDANCE

- Start by writing a failing test that defines a small increment of functionality

- Use meaningful test names that describe behavior (e.g., "shouldSumTwoPositiveNumbers")

- Make test failures clear and informative

- Write just enough code to make the test pass - no more

- Once tests pass, consider if refactoring is needed

- Repeat the cycle for new functionality

# TIDY FIRST APPROACH

- Separate all changes into two distinct types:

1. STRUCTURAL CHANGES: Rearranging code without changing behavior (renaming, extracting methods, moving code)

2. BEHAVIORAL CHANGES: Adding or modifying actual functionality

- Never mix structural and behavioral changes in the same commit

- Always make structural changes first when both are needed

- Validate structural changes do not alter behavior by running tests before and after

# COMMIT DISCIPLINE

- Only commit when:

1. ALL tests are passing

2. ALL compiler/linter warnings have been resolved

3. The change represents a single logical unit of work

4. Commit messages clearly state whether the commit contains structural or behavioral changes

- Use small, frequent commits rather than large, infrequent ones

- **Attribution**: Do not add Claude/AI attribution to commit messages - commits should reflect natural development workflow

# CODE QUALITY STANDARDS

- Eliminate duplication ruthlessly

- Express intent clearly through naming and structure

- Make dependencies explicit

- Keep methods small and focused on a single responsibility

- Minimize state and side effects

- Use the simplest solution that could possibly work

# REFACTORING GUIDELINES

- Refactor only when tests are passing (in the "Green" phase)

- Use established refactoring patterns with their proper names

- Make one refactoring change at a time

- Run tests after each refactoring step

- Prioritize refactorings that remove duplication or improve clarity

# EXAMPLE WORKFLOW

When approaching a new feature:

1. Write a simple failing test for a small part of the feature

2. Implement the bare minimum to make it pass

3. Run tests to confirm they pass (Green)

4. Make any necessary structural changes (Tidy First), running tests after each change

5. Commit structural changes separately

6. Add another test for the next small increment of functionality

7. Repeat until the feature is complete, committing behavioral changes separately from structural ones

Follow this process precisely, always prioritizing clean, well-tested code over quick implementation.

Always write one test at a time, make it run, then improve structure. Always run all the tests (except long-running tests) each time.

# PROJECT ECOSYSTEM OVERVIEW

This is the eddi-lab meta-repository containing 4 integrated projects:

- **StreamPoseML**: Real-time pose extraction and feature engineering (Python/React)
- **Skeleton-MHI**: Novel gesture segmentation using keypoint-based Motion History Images (Rust) 
- **Eddi**: Spatial intelligence and AI Director for environmental response (Python)
- **Eddi-pad**: High-performance device control and simulation environment (Rust)

## DATA FLOW PIPELINE
```
Input → StreamPoseML → Skeleton-MHI → Eddi → Eddi-pad → Devices
Devices  (pose data)   (gesture      (spatial (device   (output)
                       segments)     response) control)
```

## LEGACY SYSTEM CONTEXT

### Lumi (PI3E) - Working Legacy Implementation
- **Current Status**: Functional Kinect-based lighting control system
- **Location**: `eddi/src/lumi.py` and related components
- **Purpose**: Original thesis implementation for movement-responsive environments
- **Key Components**: OSC/DMX communication, spatial zones, gesture recognition

### Migration Strategy
```
Legacy Lumi → Analysis → Eddi Architecture → Component Migration → Feature Parity → Deprecation
```

**Critical Legacy Components to Migrate:**
- `lumi.py` - Main orchestration (→ Eddi-pad)
- `director.py` - AI decision-making (→ Eddi) 
- `mhi.py` - Motion History Images (→ Skeleton-MHI)
- `spatial_light_controller.py` - Device control (→ Eddi-pad)
- `sequencer.py` - Temporal coordination (→ Eddi)

## STARTING A NEW SESSION

1. **Check TodoRead** to see current task status
2. **Review open issues** with `gh issue list` to understand priorities
3. **Identify the next logical component** to work on based on dependencies
4. **Follow TDD cycle** for all development work

## ISSUE ORGANIZATION STRATEGY

### Main eddi-lab repo (this one):
- Cross-project epics and architecture decisions
- Integration specifications between components
- Research coordination (Skeleton-MHI paper, migration strategies)
- Ecosystem-wide planning and roadmaps

### Individual project repos:
- Implementation details following TDD cycles
- Project-specific bugs and features
- Performance optimizations
- Documentation updates

## GITHUB WORKFLOW

When working on GitHub issues, follow these steps:

1. Use `gh issue view` to get the issue details
2. Understand the problem described in the issue
3. Search the codebase for relevant files
4. Implement the necessary changes to fix the issue
5. Write and run tests to verify the fix
6. Ensure code passes linting and type checking
7. Create a descriptive commit message
8. Push and create a PR

Remember to use the GitHub CLI (`gh`) for all GitHub-related tasks.

## DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
- Establish Skeleton-MHI as separate project with novel MHI approach
- Design unified data flow pipeline and API specifications
- Create TDD-driven device abstraction layer in Eddi-pad

### Phase 2: Integration
- Migrate MHI code from Eddi to Skeleton-MHI
- Implement WebSocket communication between components
- Build 2D spatial visualization in Eddi-pad

### Phase 3: Research Output
- Document Skeleton-MHI approach in publishable paper
- Validate gesture segmentation performance
- Demonstrate end-to-end pipeline functionality

## ARCHITECTURE PRINCIPLES

- **Performance First**: Sub-millisecond latency for device communication
- **Device Agnostic**: Unified interface for virtual and physical targets
- **Spatial Intelligence**: Leverage proven spatial zone models
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between pose analysis, gesture segmentation, spatial response, and device control

## RESEARCH GOALS

- **Novel Contribution**: Skeleton-MHI extends traditional MHI to keypoint data
- **Practical Application**: Real-time interactive installation control
- **Academic Output**: Publishable research on gesture segmentation techniques

# Rust-specific

Prefer functional programming style over imperative style in Rust. Use Option and Result combinators (map, and_then, unwrap_or, etc.) instead of pattern matching with if let or match when possible.
