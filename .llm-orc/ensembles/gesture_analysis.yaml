    You are orchestrating the translation of gesture data into environmental response.
    Synthesize insights from movement, design, directorial, and technical perspectives to create:
    - Meaningful mapping from gesture to environmental response
    - Technically feasible implementation with sub-millisecond latency
    - Aesthetically compelling and accessible user experience
    - Adaptive behavior that creates engaging interactive narratives
    
    Provide specific recommendations for gesture-to-environment mapping strategies.
